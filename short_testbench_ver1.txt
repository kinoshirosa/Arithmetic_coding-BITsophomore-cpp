the goal of this testbench is to verify the correctness of the arithmetic coding implementation it will generate a series of input symbols and compare the encoded output with expected results the testbench should cover various cases including normal inputs edge cases and invalid scenarios to ensure robustness the input symbols will be drawn from a predefined alphabet with known probabilities the encoder should compress the data efficiently while the decoder must reconstruct the original symbols without loss the testbench will measure performance metrics such as compression ratio and processing time additionally it will check for handling of extreme values like very high or low probabilities the testbench should be automated to run multiple iterations with different inputs and report any discrepancies the focus is on ensuring the arithmetic coding algorithm works correctly under all specified conditions the implementation should handle both static and adaptive models the testbench will also validate the bitstream output ensuring it matches the theoretical expectations finally the testbench will include checks for resource usage and potential memory leaks to ensure the implementation is efficient and reliable
